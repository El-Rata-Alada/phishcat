# phishcat

An Email Scanner Tool built for cybersecurity use that parses and normalizes raw email headers,
reconstructs mail routing paths, and analyzes sender identity and authentication results (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).
It detects spoofing, phishing indicators, header tampering, suspicious routing behavior, 
and extracts IOCs like IPs and domains, making it useful for SOC analysts, blue teams, and forensic investigations.
